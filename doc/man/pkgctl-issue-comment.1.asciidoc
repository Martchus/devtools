pkgctl-issue-comment - Comment on an issue

Synopsis
--------
pkgctl issue comment [OPTIONS] [IID]

Description
-----------

This command allows users to add comments to an issue in Arch Linux packaging
projects. This command is useful for providing feedback, updates, or any
additional information related to an issue directly within the project's issue
tracking system.

specify a different package base if needed.

Users can provide a comment message directly through the command line, ensuring
quick and efficient communication. Additionally, for more detailed or formatted
comments, users have the option to edit their comment using a text editor
before submitting it.

Options

*-m, --message MSG*::
	Use the provided message as the comment

*-e, --edit*::
	Edit the comment using an editor
