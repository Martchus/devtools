====================

Name
----
pkgctl-issue-edit - Edit and modify an issue

Synopsis
--------
pkgctl issue edit [OPTIONS] [IID]

Description
-----------

The pkgctl issue edit command is used to modify an existing issue in Arch Linux
packaging projects. This command allows users to update the issue's title,
description, and various attributes, ensuring that the issue information
remains accurate and up-to-date. It also provides a streamlined facility
for bug wranglers to categorize and prioritize issues efficiently.

To edit an issue, users must specify the issue ID (IID). By default, the
command operates within the current directory, but users can specify a
different package base if needed.

The command allows for direct updates to the issue title and description. For
more extensive changes, users can edit these details using a text editor. The
command provides various options to set or update labels and attributes such as
confidentiality, priority, resolution, scope, severity, and status. These
options help maintain clear and organized issue management.

In case of a failed run, the command can automatically recover to ensure that
the editing process is completed without losing any data.

This command is particularly useful for maintainers and contributors who need
to update the details of an issue to reflect new information or changes in
status. It ensures that all issue details are accurately maintained,
facilitating efficient tracking and resolution.
