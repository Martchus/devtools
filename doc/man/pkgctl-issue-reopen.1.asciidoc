pkgctl-issue-reopen(1)
======================

Name
----
pkgctl-issue-reopen - Reopen a closed issue

Synopsis
--------
pkgctl issue reopen [OPTIONS] [IID]

Description
-----------

The reopen command is used to reopen a previously closed issue in Arch Linux
packaging projects. This command is useful when an issue needs to be revisited
or additional work is required after it was initially closed.

To edit an issue, users must specify the issue ID (IID). By default, the
command operates within the current directory, but users can specify a
different package base if needed.

Users can provide a message directly through the command line to explain the
reason for reopening the issue. For more detailed explanations or to provide
additional context, users have the option to edit the reopening comment using a
text editor before submitting it.

Options
-------

*-p, --package* 'PKGBASE'::
	Interact with `PKGBASE` instead of the current directory

*-m, --message* 'MSG'::
	Use the provided message as the comment

*-e, --edit*::
	Edit the comment using an editor

*-h, --help*::
	Show a help text
