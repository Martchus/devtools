pkgctl-issue-create(1)
======================

Name
----
pkgctl-issue-create - Create a new issue

Synopsis
--------
pkgctl issue create [OPTIONS]

Description
-----------

The create command is used to create a new issue for an Arch Linux package.
This command is suitable for reporting bugs, regressions, feature requests, or
any other issues related to a package. It provides a flexible way to document
and track new issues within the project's issue tracking system.

By default, the command operates within the current directory, but users can
specify a different package base if needed.

Users can provide a title for the issue directly through the command line. The
issue description can be supplied from a file or edited using a text editor.
Alternatively, users can opt to continue the issue creation process using the
web interface for a more interactive experience.

The command allows setting various labels and attributes for the issue, such as
confidentiality, priority, scope, severity, and status. These options help
categorize and prioritize the issue appropriately within the tracking system.

In case of a failed run, the command can automatically recover to ensure that
the issue creation process is completed without losing any data.

This command is essential for maintainers, contributors, and users who need to
report new issues related to Arch Linux packages.
